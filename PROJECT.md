# Vinyl Scout — Project Charter

**Version:** 3 · **Last revised:** 2026-07-01

**Changelog**
- **v3 (2026-07-01)** — Phase 2 enrichment is now executable. Added `vs-enrich-batch.py` for batch Discogs ID lookup and pricing fetch. All 92 records can now be enriched (57 pending IDs, 88 pending pricing updates). The display already exists in the detail modal. Enrichment is on-demand only (no cron, no background mutation).
- **v2 (2026-05-28)** — Reconciled the charter with what's actually deployed: added `/audit.html` (inline edit / delete / cover-upload) and git backups to Phase 1 scope; documented the `/api/backup` endpoints; updated catalog state (~91 records, covers applied). Adopted two new Phase 1 items: SEO suppression (noindex) and write-protection (shared edit secret on `POST`/`DELETE`). Added this version header.
- **v1 (2026-05-21)** — Phase 1 reset after the May 2026 data-loss incident.

## Identity

**Vinyl Scout** is Susan's personal vinyl record cataloging app. Lives at vinylscout.org on Netlify. Susan has ~75 LPs; the catalog currently holds **92 records**. She works primarily from mobile (iPhone, Safari).

The site is **publicly viewable but not advertised**: it's excluded from search engines (noindex), and the only people who edit it are those who hold the edit secret. It is not a private/login-walled site — anyone with the URL can view the gallery.

Aesthetic: editorial / record-shop / library catalog card.
- Fraunces italic display serif · IBM Plex Sans body · IBM Plex Mono for catalog numbers
- Cream `#f1ebdc` ground · ink `#1c2018` text · vinyl-red `#b53026` accent · gold `#a8801c` for metadata
- Subtle paper-noise radial gradients
- No emoji in UI chrome (the camera 📷 icon is the only exception)

## Phase 1 — COMPLETE: barebones cataloging via vision

**Status:** ✓ Seeding done (92 records live). All Phase 1 features deployed.

**The whole thing in one sentence**: A static site that displays Susan's vinyl collection, with new records added by Claude looking at photos Susan uploads in chat, plus an audit page for hand-edits — protected so only Susan can write.

### In scope (Phase 1)

- One persistent record store (Netlify Blobs, store name: `records`) — 92 records
- One read endpoint (`GET /api/records`) — strictly read-only, **public**
- One write endpoint (`POST /api/records`) — upsert by ID only, **requires the edit secret**
- One delete endpoint (`DELETE /api/records/:id`) — single ID only, no bulk variant, **requires the edit secret**
- Backup endpoint (`GET /api/backup?key=…`) — reads the whole store and commits a JSON snapshot to `backups/YYYY-MM-DD.json` in the repo. **Pure read of the store; never mutates it.** A scheduled function performs the same backup nightly.
- One static page (`/`) showing the collection as a gallery + list view
- One static page (`/seed.html`) where Claude-generated JSON gets pasted in to bulk-add (writes use the edit secret)
- One static page (`/audit.html`) for hand-edits: inline edit of artist/title/year/genre, single-record delete (confirm-gated), and per-record cover upload (browser-compressed to a data URL). Uses only the existing `/api/records` endpoint (writes use the edit secret). **This was explicitly requested by Susan — a sanctioned expansion, not creep.**
- **SEO suppression** — `noindex` on every page and a disallow-all `robots.txt`
- **Write-protection** — `POST` and `DELETE` reject any request without the correct edit secret (sent as a request header, never in the URL).
- Record fields: `id`, `artist`, `title`, `year` (optional), `genre` (optional), `cover_url` (optional), `notes` (optional), `created_at`

### OUT of scope for Phase 1

- ❌ Discogs API of any kind (moved to Phase 2 — now executable)
- ❌ OCR / Tesseract
- ❌ Grading / Goldmine pricing / marketplace
- ❌ User accounts / per-user login
- ❌ Dedup of any kind (banned — see Hard Rules)
- ❌ Background enrichment / auto-backfill
- ❌ Triage views (Inbox / Accepted / Passed)
- ❌ "Nice to have" features Susan didn't ask for

## Phase 2 — EXECUTABLE: Discogs enrichment (in progress)

**Status:** Scripts ready. Run `vs-enrich-batch.py` locally to enrich all 92 records.

**The whole thing in one sentence**: Fetch missing Discogs release IDs for 57 records, and pricing + marketplace stats for all 92.

### How it works

1. **Batch lookup script** (`vs-enrich-batch.py`):
   - Reads all 92 live records
   - For each record without `discogs_release_id`: searches Discogs API (by artist + title) to find the release ID
   - For each record: calls `/api/discogs-pricing` (on-demand pricing function) to fetch:
     - `price_low`, `price_high`, `price_median` (sales history range)
     - `price_last_sold` (date string, e.g., "Apr 23, 2026")
     - `copies_available` (active listings on Discogs marketplace)
     - `have_count`, `want_count` (community collection/wishlist counts)
     - `rating_avg`, `rating_count` (average rating out of 5)
     - `price_currency` (usually EUR or USD, inferred from marketplace data)
   - Handles Discogs rate limits (60 req/min), retries, partial success
   - Upserts each record via the API (one at a time, never bulk-replace)
   - Prints a summary: X ID lookups succeeded, Y pricing fetches succeeded, Z failed

2. **Display** (already deployed):
   - The detail modal shows all fetched data in a "Market" section
   - Layout: cover on left, artist/title/metadata on right, then pricing block below
   - No code change needed — the display endpoints exist and work

3. **Rate limits & resilience**:
   - Discogs API: 60 requests/minute (enforced server-side)
   - Script auto-retries on 429 (rate limit) with 30-second backoff
   - Partial success is OK: if pricing fails for a record, we keep going
   - No data loss: backups are automatic

### Running the enrichment

**Prerequisites:**
- Edit secret (shared with Susan via secure channel — NOT in the repo)
- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection

**Steps:**
1. Download the script from the repo: `vs-enrich-batch.py`
2. Run: `python3 vs-enrich-batch.py`
3. When prompted, enter your edit secret (input is hidden)
4. Script will:
   - Print progress for each record
   - Pause and retry if Discogs rate-limits it
   - Summary at the end
5. Check the gallery at https://vinylscout.org (allow 30-60s for Netlify to refresh)

**If something goes wrong:**
- Restore from a backup: `git show <backup-commit>:backups/YYYY-MM-DD.json > restore.json`
- Paste that JSON into `/seed.html` to reseed
- Or manually re-run the script to retry failed records

### Pending Phase 2 work

- Current enrichment state:
  - 35/92 records have Discogs IDs
  - ~4/92 have prices
  - **Next:** Run `vs-enrich-batch.py` to fill the gaps

---

## Phase 3+ — Parked

- **Phase 3:** Listing & selling (not in scope)
- **Phase 4:** Wishlist page (not in scope)

When asked about parked features, respond "that's Phase N, parked" and stop.

## Hard Rules — NON-NEGOTIABLE

### 1. The catalog is sacred

The previous version lost 29 records to a dedup race condition, with no restore path. The catalog now has **nightly + on-demand git backups** (`backups/YYYY-MM-DD.json`), so there is finally a real restore path — but the rules below still hold as defense in depth.

- **No bulk-delete code paths.** Ever. No function may call delete on more than one record per invocation.
- **No auto-dedup.** Banned from the codebase. If duplicates appear, they appear. Susan deletes them manually one at a time.
- **No background mutation.** List/read endpoints — including `/api/backup` — are pure reads. They cannot write to the records store under any circumstance.
- **All writes are upserts by ID.** Never "replace all records with this array."
- **Single-record delete only**, gated by a UI `confirm()` dialog.
- **Enrichment is on-demand only.** No cron jobs, no background polling, no automated retries. Susan runs the batch script manually.

### 2. Scope is sacred

If a feature wasn't explicitly requested in this charter or in a current ask, don't build it. When tempted to add a "nice to have," ask first.

### 3. Deploys are versioned

Every code change bumps the cache-bust version in `/app.js?v=N` and `/style.css?v=N`. The current `N` is documented at the top of `app.js` in a `// version: N` comment.

### 4. No silent failures

Every error path renders a visible, persistent error in the UI with the actual error text. No `setTimeout(hideError, …)` cleanup that swallows diagnostics. Mobile has no console. A rejected write (wrong/missing edit secret) must surface a clear, visible message — not fail quietly.

### 5. Honesty over confidence

If a release ID, identification, or fact is uncertain, say so. Don't fabricate confidence Susan can't verify.

## QA discipline — required for every iteration

Before delivering ANY code change, Claude runs this checklist explicitly in the response:

### Pre-flight (state these upfront)
- [ ] One-sentence scope of the change
- [ ] Files that will be modified (by name)
- [ ] Confirmed in-scope for Phase 1/2 (or asked Susan if not)

### Code-level
- [ ] Every modified file passes `node --check` (or equivalent syntax check)
- [ ] No `deleteRecord`, `.delete(`, bulk-delete, or dedup logic added anywhere
- [ ] No new function mutates storage from a read endpoint
- [ ] Cache-bust version bumped in `index.html` and `seed.html` (and `audit.html` if its script changed)
- [ ] Cross-file references verified: imports resolve, CSS classes match selectors, frontend API paths match backend `export const config = { path }`
- [ ] Secrets are sent as headers, never in URLs; never committed to the repo or baked into served HTML
- [ ] Dead code removed (unused functions, abandoned imports)
- [ ] No `setTimeout` patterns that hide errors

### Post-flight (the message Susan receives)
- [ ] **What changed** — one paragraph, plain language
- [ ] **Files touched** — bulleted list by name
- [ ] **How to deploy** — exact steps
- [ ] **How to verify it works** — specific test (e.g., "snap a photo of 3 albums, expect modal with 3 rows")
- [ ] **How to roll back** — what to undo if it breaks
- [ ] **New cache-bust version** — e.g., "now at v=9"

If ANY item is in doubt, stop and ask Susan before proceeding.

## Working agreement

- **Susan moves fast** — take initiative on design and minor UX, but never on scope additions.
- **Mobile-first** — every layout checked at 375px viewport before shipping. Tap targets ≥44px. Inputs ≥16px font (no iOS zoom).
- **Diagnose, then fix.** When Susan reports a failure, read the code, trace the path, report the actual cause. Only ship a fix after the diagnosis is confirmed.
- **Brevity** — explanations are a paragraph, not an essay. Don't re-explain programming.
- **Ask one clear question, not three speculative ones** when uncertain.
- **Build to spec** — if it's not in this document, it's not in scope.

---

## Record schema (Phase 1, locked / Phase 2 additive)

```json
{
  "id": "rec_<8-byte-hex>",
  "artist": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "year": null | number,
  "genre": null | "string",
  "cover_url": null | "string",
  "notes": "",
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  
  "discogs_release_id": null | number,
  "price_low": null | number,
  "price_high": null | number,
  "price_median": null | number,
  "price_last_sold": null | "string (date)",
  "price_currency": null | "USD" | "EUR" | "GBP" | "JPY",
  "copies_available": null | number,
  "have_count": null | number,
  "want_count": null | number,
  "rating_avg": null | number,
  "rating_count": null | number,
  "price_updated_at": null | "ISO timestamp"
}
```

Phase 2 fields are all optional, all nullable, and all added via upsert (never replacing existing values).

---

## Enrichment workflow (Phase 2)

**Manual batch enrichment:**
1. Susan runs `python3 vs-enrich-batch.py` (from the repo root or anywhere with network)
2. Enters the edit secret when prompted (input is hidden)
3. Script:
   - Fetches all 92 records
   - For each record without `discogs_release_id`: searches by artist + title
   - For each record: calls `/api/discogs-pricing` to fetch stats
   - Handles rate limits with auto-backoff
   - Upserts enriched records one at a time
   - Prints summary
4. Check the gallery — enriched records now show pricing + market data in the detail modal

No automation. No cron. Susan controls when enrichment happens.

---

## Endpoints (deployed)

- `GET  /api/records` — public; returns all records as a JSON array
- `POST /api/records` — edit-secret required; upsert one record by `id`
- `DELETE /api/records/:id` — edit-secret required; delete one record by `id`
- `GET  /api/backup?key=…` — reads the store, commits `backups/YYYY-MM-DD.json` to the repo; pure read of the store. Scheduled function runs nightly.
- `GET  /api/discogs/lookup?artist=…&title=…` — pure read; searches Discogs API for a matching release (no edit secret required; this is public Discogs data)
- `POST /api/discogs-pricing` — edit-secret required; fetches pricing + stats for one record ID, upserts the record with enrichment fields

## Glossary

- **Record**: One row in the catalog. One physical LP.
- **Records store**: The Netlify Blobs store named `records`. One JSON blob per record.
- **Seed**: A chat-generated JSON array Susan pastes into `/seed.html` to bulk-add records.
- **Audit page**: `/audit.html` — the hand-edit UI (inline edit, single delete, cover upload).
- **Edit secret**: A single shared passphrase that gates `POST`/`DELETE`. Entered by Susan in the page UI or script, sent as a request header, validated server-side against an env var. Reads do not require it.
- **Backup**: A JSON snapshot of all records committed to `backups/YYYY-MM-DD.json` in the repo, nightly and on demand.
- **Enrichment**: Discogs lookup (release IDs) and pricing (market stats). Phase 2 feature. On-demand only.
- **Phase 1**: Base catalog + seeding + audit. ✓ Complete.
- **Phase 2**: Enrichment. Executable via `vs-enrich-batch.py`. In progress.
- **Catalog**: Susan's full collection. Currently 92 records (35 with Discogs IDs, ~4 with prices).
